ALX Task 0x14 - Bit Manipulation in C 

This directory contains solutions to the ALX School's Task 0x14, which focuses on bit manipulation in C programming. The solutions are implemented in C and cover various aspects of working with bits, including binary-to-unsigned integer conversion, bitwise operations, and bit manipulation techniques.

Files  

The directory contains the following files:

0-binary_to_uint.c: C source file that implements a function binary_to_uint which converts a binary number represented as a string to an unsigned int. 

1-print_binary.c: C source file that implements a function print_binary which prints the binary representation of an unsigned long int. 

2-get_bit.c: C source file that implements a function get_bit which retrieves the value of a bit at a given index in an unsigned long int. 

3-set_bit.c: C source file that implements a function set_bit which sets the value of a bit at a given index in an unsigned long int. 

4-clear_bit.c: C source file that implements a function clear_bit which clears the value of a bit at a given index in an unsigned long int. 

5-flip_bits.c: C source file that implements a function flip_bits which calculates the number of bits needed to be flipped to convert one unsigned long int to another.
